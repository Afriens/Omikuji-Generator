# Omikuji-Generator Idea

## Definition & Inspiration
Omikuji are Japanese fortune slips from temples, offering predictions on aspects like love, health, or work, ranging from great luck to bad luck.

The main reason why I choosed this project is because Omikuji sounds like a good way to practice JS Skills.
It doesn't need any input of personal information which allows anyone to try it, and its a fun way to know your fortune in depth.
There are many ways in Japan to get your fortune with Omikuji, but the most common one is by shaking a box to get a small stick with a number which tells you which box to open. 
This container allows you to retrieve a piece of paper with your fortune.

All of those steps could be done with JS and allows me work with Arrays in different ways since it the paper itself with the fortune comes with different sections like a poem/phrase, the fortune, the advice and more.
For this project I will only focus on 4.

## Sections

### The Phrases / Waka
The odd phrases at the beginning of some Omikuji are usually traditional Japanese poems or proverbs. These lines are known as **waka** or simply introductory phrases that reflect the philosophy or general tone of the prediction.
I think is important to keep it, since it's a japanese tradition, otherwise it could be mistaken for a horoscope.

### The Fortune Level / Unsei
The core part of the Omikuji and probably the part that will have more code. There are in total 12 Fortune Levels:
+ Daikichi (大吉), excelente buena suerte
+ Chūkichi (中吉), buena suerte moderada
+ Shōkichi (小吉), pequeña buena suerte
+ Kichi (吉), suerte
+ Hankichi (半吉), media suerte
+ Suekichi (末吉), suerte futura
+ Sueshōkichi (末小吉), pequeña suerte futura
+ Kyō (凶), mala suerte
+ Shōkyō (小凶), pequeña mala suerte
+ Hankyō (半凶), media mala suerte
+ Suekyō (末凶), mala suerte futura
+ Daikyō (大凶), gran mala suerte

Each one with a random generated fortune depending on the fortune received.

### The Advice
Suggestions to improve or avoid problems depending on the fortune received.

### The Results
All the good luck results will give two options: to keep the Omikuji to make it real or to tied it to amplify the luck.
All the bad luck options will give two options: to keep it tied to get rid of the bad luck or give a small warning if you want to keep it.

## W.I.P. & Thoughts
This is one of my first times doing a project without any guideline, so I appreciate any advice.
For now I will avoid working in any visual representation for the results section  (tied fortune in a wooden structure) as well as shaking the box to get a number before recibing the fortune.
If possible once I learn more about interactive websites, I will comeback to this project to finish it.
